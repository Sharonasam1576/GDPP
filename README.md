# Glassdoor Salary Prediction
This project explores salary prediction using job postings data from Glassdoor.com (2017â€“2018) with a focus on roles in the tech industry. It aims to help job seekers, recruiters, employers, and analysts understand compensation patterns based on various factors like job title, company rating, location, skills, and industry. Leveraging powerful Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Scikit-learn, the project includes extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, clustering analysis, and rich visualizations such as salary distribution histograms, skill frequency charts, boxplots by seniority and company age, rating correlations, and word clouds of job descriptions. The analysis revealed that high-paying roles are concentrated in data science and cloud-related fields, with cities like San Francisco and New York offering premium compensation. Skills like Python, SQL, and machine learning were strongly associated with higher salaries, and better-rated or larger companies typically offered more competitive packages. This end-to-end analysis provides valuable insights for informed career decisions, strategic recruitment, and salary benchmarking, while also suggesting future enhancements like model deployment, real-time job feed integration, cost-of-living salary adjustment, and interactive dashboards for broader accessibility and business impact.
